# ReactJS
Created this for learning purpose 

## Installation:

-  Check the node version is available by using the command `node -v`.

-  Create a new project for React using the command `npx- create-react-app <project-name>`.

-  It will create all the necessary packages and dependencies that need to develop a react project.

## Traversing Directory Structures:

- We can see the gitingnore and that includes all the necessary packages and dependencies for the project. 
     -  Ex. node_modules, package.json etc

- Inside the `src` folder we can see the necessary .js files like `app.js`.

- In the `README.md` file inside the src folder, we can see some basic details for the project.

## Start the app:

-  In the index.js file, we can see the basic file that needed for parent component.

-  In that we can see the we get the element ID `root` which is the builtin component to include the html files.

-  cd into the project folder and give `npm start`.

-  It will open the `localhost:3000` browser, which includes the basic react view.

## App component:

-  The App component is the default component, which is created when we create the react app.

-  In index.js file, we can view that `./App` is imported.

-  In that `app component` is injected into the DOM and ID is get from the `root`.
